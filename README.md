# Email Spam Classifier
<h3>What is Email Spam?</h3>
Email spam, also called junk email, is unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email (spamming). The name comes from Spam luncheon meat by way of a Monty Python sketch in which Spam is ubiquitous, unavoidable, and repetitive.

<h3>What libraries have I used?</h3>
I've used pandas, numpy, nltk and string libraries of python.

<h3>What concept did I use?</h3>
I've used Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, because it is more suitable for classification of discrete values (ex: word counts in text classification)

<h3>The process:</h3>
<ul>
          <li>Importing required libraries</li>
          <li>Loading data</li>
          <li>Cleaning data</li>
          <li>Training the model</li>
          <li>Testing the model</li>
          <li>Visualization</li>
</ul>

Dataset: The dataset used for this project is UCI SMS spam collection dataset.
